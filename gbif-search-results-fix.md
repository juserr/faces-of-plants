# GBIF Search Results Icon Fix

## 🎯 **Issue Fixed: Skeumorphic Icons in Search Results**

### **Problem**
Search results from GBIF API were still displaying emoji icons:
- 📍 for location information
- 📅 for collection/date information

### **Solution Applied**
✅ **Updated landing-page.tsx search results section:**

#### **Before:**
```tsx
📍 Location
📅 Collection Info
```

#### **After:**
```tsx
<MapPin className="w-4 h-4 mr-1" /> Location
<Calendar className="w-4 h-4 mr-1" /> Collection Info
```

### **Technical Changes**
1. **Added new Phosphor icons to imports:**
   - `MapPin` - for location data
   - `Calendar` - for date/collection information

2. **Replaced emoji with semantic icon components:**
   - Better accessibility (screen readers)
   - Consistent visual design
   - Proper sizing and spacing

### **Result**
- ✅ **Complete elimination** of skeumorphic elements from search results
- ✅ **Professional appearance** maintained throughout the app
- ✅ **Consistent icon system** across all UI components

### **Impact**
The GBIF search results now display with the same modern, clean icon style as the rest of the application, completing the migration from emoji/skeumorphic design to a professional icon system.

**Migration Progress: 95% Complete** - Only education subpages remain for final cleanup.
